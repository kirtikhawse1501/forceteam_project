Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and SQL for the database, this system automates and simplifies the assignment of daily duties, tracking of current postings, and processing of transfer requests. It saves time, maintains clear records, and enhances communication, making administrative tasks more efficient and transparent.
